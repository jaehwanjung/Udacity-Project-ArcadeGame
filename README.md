###[PROJECT @ UDACITY]

March 21, 2015

-----------------

###Project Overview
Build an arcade game using Object-Oriented programming. A very basic template is provided with no functionality.
Player can not move off screen, vehicles cross the screen, vehicle-player collision resets the game). Can add additional functionality to the game beyond minimum requirements (add collectible items on screen, multiple vehicle types, timed games, etc).
Code should be formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting

### Learning Outcome
* Object-Oriented JavaScript
* HTML5 Canvas

###How to run and play the game:
0. Open index.html
0. Choose your character.
0. Press the start button. The start button has an arrow icon.
0. Use your arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player.
0. Press the stop button if you'd like to pause the game. The stop button is located at the same location as the start button. When you clicked the start button in Step#3, it has flipped into the stop button.
0. To restart the game, press the restart button. The restart button has the circular icon.

###Game Rules:

 * The speed of enemies and the frequency of spawning enemies will be increased.
 * The position of the player will be reset.
0. Effects of items: 
 * Blue Gem: Removes all enemies on the map.
